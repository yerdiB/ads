In Binary Search, we first compare the given element x with middle of the array. If x matches with middle element, then we return middle index. Otherwise, we either recur for left half of array or right half of array. So recurrence is T(n) = T(n/2) + O(1) Given a sorted array of integers, what can be the minimum worst case time complexity to find ceiling of a number x in given array? Ceiling of an element x is the smallest element present in array which is greater than or equal to x. Ceiling is not present if x is greater than the maximum element present in array. For example, if the given array is {12, 67, 90, 100, 300, 399} and x = 95, then output should be 100. A B D Searching Discuss it Question 3 Explanation: We modify standard binary search to find ceiling. The time complexity T(n) can be written as T(n) <= T(n/2) + O(1) Solution of above recurrence can be obtained by Master Method. It falls in case 2 of Master Method. Solution is O(Logn). [sourcecode language="C"] #include /* Function to get index of ceiling of x in arr[low..high]*/ int ceilSearch(int arr[], int low, int high, int x) { int mid; /* If x is smaller than or equal to the first element, then return the first element */ if(x <= arr[low]) return low; /* If x is greater than the last element, then return -1 */ if(x > arr[high]) return -1; /* get the index of middle element of arr[low..high]*/ mid = (low + high)/2; /* low + (high - low)/2 */ /* If x is same as middle element, then return mid */ if(arr[mid] == x) return mid; /* If x is greater than arr[mid], then either arr[mid + 1] is ceiling of x or ceiling lies in arr[mid+1...high] */ else if(arr[mid] < x) { if(mid + 1 <= high && x <= arr[mid+1]) return mid + 1; else return ceilSearch(arr, mid+1, high, x); } /* If x is smaller than arr[mid], then either arr[mid] is ceiling of x or ceiling lies in arr[mid-1...high] */ else { if(mid - 1 >= low && x > arr[mid-1]) return mid; else return ceilSearch(arr, low, mid - 1, x); } } /* Driver program to ▲ We use cookies to ensure you have the best browsing experience on our website.

A B Searching Discuss it Question 4 Explanation: The above program doesn’t work for the cases where element to be searched is the last element of Y[] or greater than the last element (or maximum element) in Y[]. For such cases, program goes in an infinite loop because i is assigned value as k in all iterations, and i never becomes equal to or greater than j.
